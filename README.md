# My work
### Character movement and abillites

### Small features
To many whales at the same time made the game lagg so i added render distance to the whales.
I thoght it looked wierd when they spawned in out of nowhere so i created a script that fades the material of the whales in and out:

### LevelDesign
Starlitseas has 8 levels and i made them increassingly harder and longer, adding different obsticles and changing the envoiroment to make every level special. 
The player follows the whales and floating islands throughout every level, the whales follows splines and thats how the levels are built. 
Level1: 
The first level Starts at the beach and the bridge is higher than you can walk so the only way to get forward in the game is to learn to jump. there is also the talking ray guide that says the controlls to the player
