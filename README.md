# My work
### Character movement and abillites

### Small features
To many whales at the same time made the game lagg so i added render distance to the whales.
I thoght it looked wierd when they spawned in out of nowhere so i created a script that fades the material of the whales in and out:

### LevelDesign
Starlitseas has 8 levels and i made them increasingly harder and longer, adding different obsticles and changing the envoiroment to make every level special while keeping the same theme. 

The player follows the whales and floating islands throughout every level, the whales follows splines and thats how the levels are built. 

### Level1: 
The first level starts at the beach and the bridge is higher than the player can walk, so the only way to get forward in the game is to learn to jump. there is also a spirit guide that shows the player the basic controls.

Level 1 is straight forward with only whale sharks, making it hard to fail. The player learns to jump on whales that slowly moves forward.

### Level2: 
The second level is sleightly longer, moving upwards making it harder to jump on the whales, introducing blow whales that shoots the player in the air when walking on them.

Still an easy level but introdusing new elements.

### Level3: 
The third level is an introduction level for the glide mechanic, the only way to get from one platform to another is to glide. Making the player learn how to use the mechanic in different ways.

There is no whales in this level to make the player focus on the new mechainc without being stressed by constantly having to move forward.

### Level4: 
The forth level combines the new mechanis with the whale jumping and it has two different ways of getting to the goal, one way faster than the other but more risky for the player that want to speedrun.
