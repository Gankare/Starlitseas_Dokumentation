# My work
### Character movement and abillites

### Small features
To many whales at the same time made the game lagg so i added render distance to the whales.
I thoght it looked wierd when they spawned in out of nowhere so i created a script that fades the material of the whales in and out:

### LevelDesign
Starlitseas has 8 levels, every level going upwards towards heaven. I made the levels increasingly harder and longer, the whales are guiding the player towards haven. Adding different obsticles and changing the envoiroment to make every level special while keeping the same theme. 

The player follows the whales and floating islands throughout every level, the whales follows splines and thats how the levels are built. 

### Level 1: 
The first level starts at the beach and the bridge is higher than the player can walk, so the only way to get forward in the game is to learn to jump. there is also a spirit guide that shows the player the basic controls.

Level 1 is straight forward with only whale sharks, making it hard to fail. The player learns to jump on whales that slowly moves forward.

### Level 2: 
The second level is slightly longer, moving upwards making it harder to jump on the whales, introducing blow whales that shoots the player in the air when walking on them.

Still an easy level but introducing new elements.

### Level 3: 
The third level is an introduction level for the glide mechanic and boosting rings, the only way to get from one platform to another is to use the glider and the boosts. Making the player learn how to use the mechanic in different ways.

There are no whales in this level to make the player focus on the new mechainc without being stressed by constantly having to move forward.

### Level 4: 
The fourth level combines the new mechanics with the whale jumping and it has two different ways of getting to the goal, one way faster than the other but more risky for the players that want to speedrun.

The level also has a new darker look, making it feel like your higher up than in previous levels.

The level also introduces the first obsticle that can kill you, the jellyfish rings are at the end of the level and makes for a more interesting gameplay, having to glide through them.

### Level 5: 
The fifth level is pretty straight forward, The splines are tight together with alot of obsticles to make it slower and harder for the player to go around them.

### Level 6: 
The sixth level is an introduction level for the dash mechanic, the look of the level is lighter with an aurora and fantasy feel, to create the feeling of heading towards space/upwards. 

I also added the giant whale in the background to add to the fantasy feel. The giant whale slowly goes around the map with the help of a rotating springarm set in the middle of the map.

The level is like the third level but harder. It takes a combination of all the mechanics to beat it, this level is where most players gets stuck a while and it's to makes the player ready for the last two levels.

### Level 7: 
The seventh level is the longest one, it has two possible paths for the player to go right from the start, one faster than the other. There is a bunch of gliding in this level and it gives of a magical/fantasy feeling.

Midlevel there is a giant leap of faith, fog should be hiding the islands ahead (not like in the picture below), making the player glide into the fog then revealing a bunch of islands with whales souring around them. Giving the player an epic feeling.

### Level 8: 
The eight level is the last level before ariving in heaven. whales flying in every direction and then going down again giving the feeling they have reached thier destination, leading the player towards the sky. This is the most magical looking level.

To get to the end the player has to jumo and dash from island to island, every island higher than the last, reaching the top taking them to heaven and clearing the game.

This is not soppose to be the hardest level more like a cool finishing level for the player to enjoy.
